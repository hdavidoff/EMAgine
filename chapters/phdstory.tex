What is the impact of dementia and agitation?
How is it measured at the moment?
What do I want to do: detect --> predict
What do I need to do that: data
Which data --> look into literature at the time ~ end 2020 to guide
Which sensors? Look into literature at the time + which are currently used
Protocol defined: before and after initial proposal (what I put into the amendment)
Installation + Preparation + Communication
--> what do I need to keep in mind when installing sensors on a neuropsychiatric ward:
--->talked to WONDER people, Ellen Van Lieshout (contact from LYS)
-----> be cognizant of cables/placement of sensors near TVs etc (funny to show that I could see when the TV would go on)
Move the data from UNSTRUCTURED BLOB --> STRUCTURED
Data coming in and going where? (pipelines/scripts/tables)

Pilot study: p1-9
Main: 11-26 (major analysis break)

Looking at feasibility: when C+ is on/quality of data/# nights EMFIT/days or hrs of LYS
Is it working? Let's keep going 

Data --> features --> models OR statistical analysis
